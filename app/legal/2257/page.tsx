      <p>
        OnlyAI is an online platform that enables independent creators to publish
        and monetize digital content. OnlyAI does not produce, create, or control
        creator-submitted content and is not the “primary producer” (as defined
        in 18 U.S.C. §2257 and 28 C.F.R. Part 75) of any content submitted by creators.
      </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Eligibility and Age Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          All creators publishing content on OnlyAI must be at least 18 years of age
          (or the age of majority in their jurisdiction, if higher). OnlyAI strictly
          prohibits any content involving minors or any depiction that appears to
          represent a minor.

        <p>
          OnlyAI functions solely as an interactive computer service provider.
          All content is submitted and controlled by independent creators.
          Each creator is solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all
          applicable laws and record-keeping requirements.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Record-Keeping and Custodian of Records</h2>
        <p>
          To the extent that any content is subject to the record-keeping
          requirements of 18 U.S.C. §2257, the individual creator who uploads
          and controls the content is deemed the primary producer and is solely
          responsible for maintaining the required age-verification records.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Custodian of Records for any such content is the individual
          creator who produced and uploaded the content, not OnlyAI.
