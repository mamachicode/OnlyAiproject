      <p>
        By accessing or using OnlyAI (the “Platform”), you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”).
        If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.
      </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Eligibility / Age Restriction</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, if higher) to access any adult
          content or use the Platform in any way that involves adult content. We may require additional verification and

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Platform Role</h2>
        <p>
          OnlyAI provides a subscription platform that allows independent creators (“Creators”) to publish and monetize
          digital content. OnlyAI does not produce or direct Creator content. Creators control their own content,
          pricing, and availability, subject to these Terms and our policies.

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Prohibited Content and Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          You may not upload, publish, request, or distribute content that is illegal, exploitative, or abusive.
          This includes (without limitation) any content involving minors, any depiction that suggests a minor,
          non-consensual content, sexual violence, bestiality, incest, trafficking, or any other content prohibited by law.
          We may remove content and suspend/terminate accounts at our sole discretion to enforce safety and compliance.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">4. Subscriptions, Billing, and Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
          Subscriptions grant access to a specific Creator’s content for the subscription period. Subscriptions are billed
          through our payment processors (e.g., CCBill for adult content). You may cancel at any time through the applicable
          payment processor’s support portal or by contacting support; cancellation stops renewal, and access continues until
          the end of the paid period unless otherwise required by law or processor rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Billing descriptor and payment support information are provided at checkout and/or on billing communications.
          If you believe a billing error occurred, contact support promptly.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">5. Intellectual Property / No Redistribution</h2>
        <p>
          Creator content is protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, record, redistribute, republish,
          or otherwise exploit Creator content without permission. Attempted circumvention of paywalls or access controls
          may result in termination.
